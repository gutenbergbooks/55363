<p>In these areas of Zion and
Bryce Canyon National Parks
and Cedar Breaks National
Monument, four life zones are
found extending from low elevations
of near 3,600 feet to
extremes of over 11,300 feet.
The area within elevations
from the lowest point to 4,000
feet is the Lower Sonoran
Zone; above that to 7,000 feet
is the Upper Sonoran Zone;
from 7,000 to 8,500 feet is the
Transition Zone; above that to 10,000 feet is the Canadian
Zone; and from 10,000 feet to the highest point on
Brian Head Peak is the Hudsonian Zone.</p>
<p>Native plants typical of desert, mesa and mountain
grow within these extremes of elevation and include a
wide variety of species. Of the three areas featured,
Cedar Breaks National Monument contains the greatest
variety, and frequently exhibits marvelous displays, depending
on the amount of rainfall from year to year.</p>
<p>The purpose of this booklet is to help visitors in
their enjoyment of the flowers they find along the roadways
and trails&mdash;flowers they observe, appreciate and
probably photograph but leave UNPICKED for the
pleasure of others.</p>
<p>Through the mediums of color photography and
color lithography one hundred and six species of wild
flowers and plants most commonly seen are presented
in closeup detail as an aid to identification. Brief descriptions
of size, habitat, blooming period, use, economic
value and other details are given.</p>
<p>The flowers have been arranged in a general order
of families, except that occasionally, for the convenience
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
of preparing the color plates, flowers of similar color or
density have been grouped on a page although they are
not in the same family nor closely related.</p>
<p>The Standardized Plant Names of the American
Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature has
been followed as the guide. In case of locally used common
names, such has been indicated in the text.</p>
<p>This booklet on Wild Flowers has been produced
by the Zion-Bryce Natural History Association in cooperation
with the National Park Service. The Association
has for its objective the fuller interpretation of the
scenic, scientific, aesthetic and historic values of these
National Parks, to the end that park visitors are provided
with such information, audio and visual aids as
will help them gain a better understanding and greater
appreciation of the phenomena they find in them.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this brief treatise on the flora may
prove helpful to many visitors in learning more about
some of the important species of plant life that they
may discover during their visits to the Zion and Bryce
Canyon National Parks and Cedar Breaks National
Monument.</p>

<p>Credit for the photographic work goes to several individuals, all members of
the interpretive staffs of these areas during the past few
years. Park Naturalists Carl E. Jepson and Leland F. Allen
have prepared the descriptive information given for each flower.</p>

<br /><i>Calochortus nuttallii</i></h3>
<p>The Segolily Mariposa was chosen as the State
Flower of Utah probably because of the important use
early pioneers made of the root bulbs of this plant in
supplementing their meager diets during the early settlement
period. The name &ldquo;Sego&rdquo; (pronounced see-go)
is of Shoshonean origin, and this flower was sacred in
Indian legend long before the arrival of Utah pioneers
in 1847.</p>
<p>This plant is found in rather dry, rocky soils and
puts on a very showy display during May and June. It
is more commonly known as the Mariposa Lily in other
sections of the country, but in Utah it is called the
Segolily.</p>
<p>There are three species in color of white, pink and
yellow found in the Zion Region.</p>

<h3 id="c2"><span class="jl">2. YELLOW MARIPOSA</span>Lily Family
<br /><i>Calochortus nuttallii var. aureus</i></h3>
<p>Found only in the petrified forest of the Coalpits
Wash section of Zion National Park, this plant is not
very abundant and probably suffered from overgrazing
by livestock during the settlement period before Zion
became a National Park.</p>
<p>Mariposa in Spanish means butterfly.</p>
<p>This species with bright-yellow flowers is associated
with a specific geologic stratum&mdash;the Petrified Forest
member of the Chinle formation. It is found in great
abundance in the Petrified Forest National Monument
near Holbrook, Arizona.</p>

<p>In the sandy areas at elevations above 4,000 feet you
may find this pretty, three-petaled, deep-blue flower on
its slender stalk about a foot or more in height blooming
early in June. The flowers bloom at night, so are
not easily found except early in the mornings. The plant
is fairly abundant along the Narrows Trail, the East
Rim Trail and near the East Entrance Station of Zion
National Park.</p>
<p>Indians used the entire plant for food.</p>

<p>A rather rare lily sometimes called Leopard Lily or
Bronze Bell. Its drooping flowers on fairly tall stems are
found growing in the Sagebrush areas or in alpine meadows.
As they are not very conspicuous, they are often
overlooked by visitors. The petals, with their mottled
effect in brown, yellow and purple spots, present a remarkable
pattern of beauty when observed closely. The
odor of the plant is not pleasing to humans, but is no
doubt attractive to insects.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Our Lord&rsquo;s Candlestick&rdquo; was given to
this tall, conspicuous plant of the desert by the early
Spanish Padres, who were the first white men to see
this region of Southern Utah. During May and June the
waxy-white flowers bloom on tall stalks and soon mature
into rather large seed pods.</p>
<p>Indians made very good use of all parts of the plant.
Its fiber was used for making sandals and clothing, the
seeds provided food, and the roots were used for making
soap. The Navajo Indian called it Yaybi-tsa-si, which
means literally &ldquo;Yucca of the Gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wild Buckwheat is commonly associated with Sagebrush
and arid regions of the West. Many species of
the genus are found blooming throughout the summer
season.</p>
<p>The spreading branches grow close to the ground
and help reduce erosion, and the yearly accumulation
of leaves adds humus to the soil. The flower head at the
top of single stalks, with its many-branched, dense cluster
in a lacy pattern, makes a fine floral display of yellow.
The flowers are important to the honey bee, and
the ripened seeds are diligently sought by the chipmunks,
other rodents and several birds.</p>

<br /><i>Ephedra viridis</i></h3>
<p>Not a very showy plant with its pale-green stems,
very small leaves and inconspicuous flowers. It is probably
of greatest interest because of the use made of the
plant by early pioneers in brewing a tea, which served
as a tonic for various ailments. It was commonly called
Brigham Tea, Squaw Tea or, more generally, Mormon
tea.</p>
<p>The plant is a relative of the Pines and Firs and is
very able to withstand drouth. It is found fairly abundantly

<p>If you travel to the mountains early in June or July,
you may be lucky enough to find this beautiful flower,
the dainty Calypso or Fairy Slipper Orchid, as it blooms
in the dense woods of Spruce and Pine or in the deep
canyons along shady streams at elevations above 6,000
feet. The flowers grow singly on stems 4 to 6 inches
high and have only one large leaf. The plant takes part

<p>Closely resembling the cultivated variety of Four-O&rsquo;Clock,
this plant, with its abundance of brilliant
magenta-colored flowers, is one of the spectacular sights
in May or early June. It is a sturdy perennial with thick,
glossy-green leaves spreading low over the ground. The
south-facing slopes in the Sonoran Zones are its most
common habitat, but it is also found in the broken lava
fields. Being a night bloomer, the flowers close during
the bright daylight hours and open at about four o&rsquo;clock

about two or three weeks, but it sometimes blooms
twice in the same summer.</p>

Transition Zone. Each plant has two narrow leaves near
the base, each about 2 inches long, above which are
four to five practically leafless branches with a single
flower at the top of each. The plant is rarely over 6
inches high; more commonly it is flat to the ground.
Flowers vary in color from white to pink or sometimes
the white blossoms have pink veins or stripes which
tend to accentuate their beauty. Usually one of the
early blooming flowers of the high plateaus, along with
the Indianpotato and Buttercup.</p>

lava fields of the Transition Zone in Zion National Park.
Its flower of white petals with pink veins is about 2
inches in diameter.</p>
<p>The Bitterroot was discovered in 1805 by the Lewis
and Clark expedition while passing through western
Montana. It was later named <i>Lewisia rediviva</i> by the
botanist Pursh.</p>
<p>The plant is of economic importance to the Northwestern
Indians, who discovered that the bitter, parsnip-shaped
roots possess a nutritious heart of starch,
which cooking reduces to a pasty mass, palatable, at
least, to Indian taste.</p>

<p>A plant of the high elevations, generally above 9,000
feet, and found abundantly at Cedar Breaks, where it
comes into bloom almost as soon as the first patches of
bare ground appear. Coming out usually in April or
May, depending on the season, Marshmarigolds are
among the earliest blooming flowers of the high elevations
and often carpet the alpine meadows with a
spread of white blossoms.</p>
<p>The white sepals, that make up the showy flower,
are often mistaken for petals, which are absent. The
mass of anthers of the stamens give the flower its brilliant
yellow center.</p>

in the shady canyons. In their respective areas they
are often the first flowers of Spring and are followed
closely by the Springbeauties or sometimes preceded by
the tiny white Indianpotato of the Parsnip Family.</p>
<p>A thrilling sight is to find the waxy flowers of the
early Buttercups at the very edge of the receding snowbanks.
The blooming season for Buttercups is very brief,
as a general rule, but the different species come into
bloom successively.</p>

<p>These beautiful flowers are well known because of
their wide distribution and common use as cultivated
species in flower gardens. They have conspicuously
shaped petals with long, hollow spurs, which contain
honey and thereby attract certain insects and especially
the hummingbirds. Columbines are probably the most
beautiful of the native flowers of Zion, Bryce Canyon
and Cedar Breaks, as they bring forth very attractive
displays during the summer months. The White Columbine
at Cedar Breaks is extremely large.</p>

Monkshood, but the flowers differ in color and shape.
The single spur of one of the sepals is the marked feature
of the Larkspur. Color and size vary greatly for the
different species; but the most common variety at Cedar
Breaks is 2 to 3 feet tall, and the flowers are a purplish
blue.</p>

from mid-February to April, in bare sandy places among
the Junipers and Pinyons, is the Sand Buttercup. Along
the trail to the Canyon Overlook above the Great Arch
is perhaps the best place to find this plant in Zion.</p>
<p>The flowers, a pinkish white, are found on short

known as the Oregon Grape. A rather prostrate
growth form accounts for a third common name;
namely, Creeping Barberry.</p>
<p>This plant is found sparingly scattered over the
areas and is probably more abundant in Zion than in
Bryce Canyon or Cedar Breaks. The fruit looks very
much like a cluster of grapes and is often gathered for
the making of jellies or wine. The woody stems were
used by the Indians in making a yellow dye.</p>
<p>The plants are helpful in holding the soil, as they

highway leading to Zion National Park from the west.</p>
<p>Since the plant is a secondary host of the Blackstem
Rust of cereals, it is not cultivated as an ornamental
shrub.</p>
<p>Indians used the wood of this shrub for various implements
or tools. They utilized the root, which contains
berberine, for a tonic, and they also made from
it a brilliant-yellow dye.</p>

<p>A member of the Rose Family found mostly in the
Sonoran Zones of Zion National Park. Several plants
may be seen near the South Entrance Station. It is well
named, as it has a burned and dead appearance during
much of the year; however in late April and May it
puts out minute grey-green leaves and creamy-yellow
flowers made up of four sepals and no petals. The stamens
are numerous. The Cliffrose, Bitterbrush and
Mountain-mahogany are closely related to the Blackbrush.</p>

<p>Found most commonly at Cedar Breaks, this member
of the Rose Family puts on a very showy display for
a brief period of the summer, generally in July or earlier
at lower elevations. It is a shrub commonly 2 to 3 feet
high with leaves that are five-parted, hence the name
Cinquefoil. The shrub is often dotted all over with rose-like
flowers, about an inch across, with clear-yellow
petals and deeper yellow anthers. The plant is common
in the mountains, across the continent, up to altitudes
of 10,000 feet or more.</p>

<p>A low-growing tree of the Lower Sonoran Zone.
Uncommon in Zion but fairly abundant in the desert
area adjacent to the park. In early spring during March
and April bright-green leaves cover the tree, and often
it is laden with catkinlike clusters of greenish-yellow
flowers, which attract myriads of insects including the
honey bees.</p>
<p>The wood of this tree was used extensively by early
settlers for fuel, building corrals and in making furniture

whole meadows with a mass of blue color in midsummer.</p>
<p>The Lupines range in color from pale pink to deep
purple, with some white, cream or yellow, but most
of them are blue. Like other plants of the Pea Family,
Lupines add nitrogen to the soil and thereby improve
the land on which they grow. The seeds of a few species

the Zion Region.</p>
<p>Some of the species contain a poisonous constituent
causing, the often fatal, loco disease of livestock, particularly
in horses.</p>
<p>Loco is a Spanish word meaning &ldquo;Crazy.&rdquo; Other
species known as Poisonvetch, prefer soils rich in selenium,
and take up enough of that toxic mineral to make
them poisonous to livestock, especially sheep. The
harmless species are called Milkvetch.</p>
<p>Nearly all the species are colorful and spectacular

<p>This member of the Evening-primrose Family, with
its fragrant, large white flowers, bloom early in the
evening and lasts only a few hours the next day, as it
turns pink and wilts.</p>
<p>The flowers grow close to the ground on stemless

The plants are generally small, but the flowers are fairly
showy with their five bright, pink-colored petals. They
are found generally in dry, rocky soils and bloom mostly
in early summer or during May and June. Sometimes
Phlox will cover extensive areas with a bright carpet of

on the summit of Brian Head Peak near Cedar Breaks.
These plants are very helpful in holding the soil and
in preventing erosion.</p>

<br /><i>Helianthus annuus</i></h3>
<p>The very large flowers of these plants sometimes present
a colorful display as they take over the roadways or
abandoned fields. Members of this group are generally
considered weeds because of their habit of crowding out
the more desirable species. Certain species of Sunflowers
are now being developed for commercial purposes and
produce oil for cooking and meal for livestock feed. Indians
in some areas of North America cultivated sunflowers
for food and for trade.</p>

<h3 id="c100"><span class="jl">100. GAILLARDIA</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Gaillardia parryi</i></h3>
<p>This handsome and conspicuous plant is found
growing in the Sonoran Zones of Zion. It has a slender,
rough stalk, about a foot tall, and stiff, rather hairy,
dull-green leaves growing mostly from the root. The
beautiful flowers, about three inches across, have golden-yellow
rays which are three pointed. The center of the
flower is a shaded maroon and yellow, very velvety,
and becoming an attractive fuzzy, round, purplish head
when the rays drop off. This plant blooms mostly in
May and June.</p>

<h3 id="c101"><span class="jl">101. DESERT MARIGOLD</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Baileya multiradiata</i></h3>
<p>These golden-yellow flowers, measuring about three
inches across, are fairly common along the trails and
roadways of Zion Canyon and in other low-elevation
areas of the park. They bloom during May and June.
The ray flowers become bleached and papery as they
mature, thus accounting for the name Paper Daisy. This
attractive composite is also known as Desert Baileya.
In California this plant is cultivated for the flower
trade. It has been found poisonous to sheep, although
horses crop the flower heads, apparently without harmful
effects.</p>

<h3 id="c102"><span class="jl">102. WESTERN YARROW</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Achillea lanulosa</i></h3>
<p>Western Yarrow is very widespread and can be
found in much of Western America. It is more common
at elevations above 5,000 feet in these areas. It
grows to be 12 to 20 inches high, and the fernlike leaves,
which have a pungent odor when crushed, and the
umbrella-shaped clusters of flowers are characteristics
of this plant that help to identify it.</p>
<p>Since ancient times the plant has been highly regarded
for its healing properties. Legend ascribed the
discovery of this virtue to Achilles, in whose honor the
plant is named.</p>

<h3 id="c103"><span class="jl">103. HEARTLEAF ARNICA</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Arnica cordifolia</i></h3>
<p>A common flower in the Pine and Spruce forest of
Cedar Breaks and the alpine areas of Zion and Bryce
Canyon is the Heartleaf Arnica. The yellow ray flowers
are few, while the disk or central flowers of the flower
head are numerous. The flowers measure about three
inches across and are often mistaken for sunflowers.
The heart-shaped leaves help distinguish this flower
from its close relatives.</p>
<p>Tincture of arnica is obtained from certain species
of Arnica.</p>

<h3 id="c104"><span class="jl">104. MEADOW SALSIFY</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Tragopogon pratensis</i></h3>
<p>This interesting plant, known also as Oyster Plant,
has been naturalized from Europe and is now quite
common in the West. It has a smooth, stout hollow
stem about 2 feet tall, rather dark-green, smooth leaves
clasping at the base, and handsome flowers from 2 to 4
inches across. The flowers open early in the morning,
closing at midday, to remain closed until the next
morning.</p>
<p>Meadow Salsify is most commonly found along the
roadways or in other places where the native soil has
been disturbed.</p>
<p>See <a href="#c105">Figure 105</a> for description of the seed of this
flower.</p>

<h3 id="c105"><span class="jl">105. MEADOW SALSIFY</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Tragopogon pratensis</i></h3>
<p>This habitat view of the Meadow Salsify illustrates
one of the important ways in which plants scatter their
seeds about. As the flower matures into seeds in a conspicuous
and very large, dandelion-like head, each seed
is equipped with a perfect parachute of silky fibers.
Winds often sweep these flight-equipped seeds for many
miles and result in wide dissemination of this species,
which was introduced into this country from Europe
not very long ago.</p>
<p>The seeds of many plants are scattered about in
various ways&mdash;some by wind, others by water and
many by the birds and animals.</p>

<h3 id="c106"><span class="jl">106. ARROWLEAF BALSAMROOT</span>Sunflower Family
<br /><i>Balsamorhiza sagittata</i></h3>
<p>This plant, with its large, showy yellow flowers, is
often found on the southern exposures of steep hillsides
or in the Sagebrush flats. It was first discovered by
Lewis and Clark on their expedition across the continent
in 1804-1806.</p>
<p>The rind of the root contains a turpentiny balsam,
but the heart of the root is edible and was used by the
Indians and early pioneers. The plant is called Mormon
Biscuit in Utah. The seeds of the plant were used by
the Indians to make &ldquo;Pinole&rdquo; or meal, and the stems
and leaves were eaten as greens.</p>

<br /><i>Erysimum capitatum</i></h3>
<p>There are two kinds of Wallflowers in Zion National
Park. Their bright-yellow flowers, which grow on stalks
taller than those of most other mustards, make them
among the most attractive members of this family. They
are usually found on rather dry slopes in the Upper
Sonoran and Transition Zones.</p>
<p>Notice how the petals are arranged as a cross which
is a characteristic of all members of the Cruciferae or
Mustard Family.</p>

<h3 id="c108"><span class="jl">108. BITTERCRESS</span>Mustard Family
<br /><i>Cardamine hirsuta</i></h3>
<p>You may find this plant blooming during April and
May in the Sonoran Zones of Zion National Park. Its
habitat is generally the dry sandy hillsides rather than
the deep canyons.</p>
<p>The wide-spreading, circular, doom-shaped clumps
present an attractive display in pure white flowers. The
petals of four are arranged like a cross.</p>
<p>Being a perennial, the clumps seem to expand from
year to year and often reach a spread of four to five
feet across. The plants are useful in building soil and in
preventing erosion.</p>

<br /><i>Zauschneria garrettii</i></h3>
<p>One of the late blooming plants in Zion National
Park is the Hummingbird Trumpet, also called Fire-chalice,
or sometimes the Wild Fushia. It can often be
found on the Canyon Overlook Trail or on the West
Rim Trail at elevations near 6,000 feet.</p>
<p>It can be identified by the narrow oval leaves pointed
and toothed, and the fushialike flowers, narrowly funnel-shaped,
with the pistil and stamens extending beyond
the petals.</p>
<p>The brilliant scarlet of this flower in fairly dense
clusters makes a very attractive display in late August
and September.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
